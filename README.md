# -algorithm-effeciency-grader
What this program does is test the sort algorithms of: bubble-sort insertion-sort and merge-sort.  The program will take random lists and order them, the time and complexity will be calculated and they will be graphed

### Colors for in the graph :
- Red = bubble sort
- green = insertion sort
- blue = merge sort
